# NIDAR
NIDAR is a competition held by the government of India . Competition dedicate for specifically drone of India. This year both the ps were based on presicion wherein we had to identify diseased crops and deploy other drone for spraying pesticides over it.


I have worked upton geotagging. Camera detects the yellow patched diseased plants and returns its coordinates to the ground station in real time. I have taken everything in consideration including roll, pitch and yawk and how it will effect the coordinates via rotation matrix.
Deployed this code on Rasberrypi.

Now I have started working on spray drone. We are designing it from scratch. 2 approach i suppose is feasibe
1. body framed drone
2. body structural drone

Preparing cad model for both to see which one works the best
